A long long time ago on earth there lived huge creatures called giants. 
They were tyrants led by their bloodlust and an insatiable thirst for violence.
The only one's who could stand up to them and fight them off were the brave warlords of the kingdom of blaa'ar led by their furious leader Karnius.
King Karnius was young, brave and wise.
He was fair and just and was respected by all despite his young age.
