A long long time ago on earth there lived huge creatures called giants. 
They were tyrants led by their bloodlust and an insatiable thirst for violence.
The only one's who could stand up to them and fight them off were the brave warlords of the kingdom of blaa'ar led by their furious leader Karnius.
King Karnius was young, brave and wise.
He was fair and just and was respected by all despite his young age.
The giants and the warlords kept on waging wars on each other trying to eradicate their respective races.
In the great battle of Brostenheim, King Karnius fought valiantly and with his 10 bravest warlords slayed a pack of 200 giants.
Their battle waged on for 4 days and eventually ended in the giants' defeat.
